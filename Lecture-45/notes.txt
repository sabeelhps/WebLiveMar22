CAP - Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance

SQL databases -> they ensures more Consistency over availability (very important)
              -> If schema is well defined 

NoSQL -> they ensures more availability over consitency
      -> good if schema is dynamic or not well strcutured
      -> if u want to store data as key-value pairs

    
Blog.update(), Blog.findOne()
